                    <h3>CSA are excited and proud to offer opportunities to all ages and genders! Competitive soccer is for kids and families that want a more extensive soccer experience than what our recreational program offers.    Players must tryout and be selected to play on a competitive team.  Many of our competitive teams train and have games almost year round.  This training includes a fall season, several tournaments (many require travel and an overnight stay), and some teams play a spring season. Our financial commitment is far less than most programs as teams are mostly coached by volunteers (although most have, or are working on their coaching licenses through US Soccer).</h3>
